Yes	# Your columns must be formed by only attributes you want for the classification! If you have also sample names type (Yes), If not Type (No)

500	# it is by default 300 iteration and around this, it takes the best classifier! But, increasing this can increase the accuracy of our classifier! If you have time, do this! 
20	# Amount of time for generating the first best centroid classifiers!
\t	# If your input data is csv or txt file and the features are tab separated type(\t), if comma separated Type(,),if column separated Type(:), if semi column separated Type(;). If it is excell file, you can skip filling out this this.
